# The Smoking Example 
A simulated dataset, smoker.csv [*2], has the information of 10,000 patients. Suppose that we're interested in the effects of a treatment method for a lung disease. In this scenario, we will be investigating the association between the varaibles:

* **Independent Variable (IV)**: The variable tells us whether a patient receive the treatment or was placed in a control group.
* **Dependent Variable (Outcome)**: This variable shows whether a patient survived after a certain period of time.[*3]

$$a = b + c^2 \alpha$$

# Example Math Equation
$$\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$
